and edit it as appropriate.

The course's lectures.

The course's precepts.

The course's website.

Documents that are referenced directly by the course's website. Such

The man pages on the armlab cluster.

The course's current staff members outside of class time through office
hours.
- I went twice to professor Moretti's Monday office hours

The course's current staff members outside of class time through
Piazza.
- I made a post on Piazza asking "Necessity of replicating all variables
 from a c program in an assembly one?"

Current lab teaching assistants through visits to the course labs.
- I went to lab TAs twice on Sunday and Monday before the assignment was
due

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

Not fun and not helpful. It would have been better if I had more time
so I could try the challenge part, but otherwise it was just super
tedious gdb debugging and translation. The assignment was so long that
my understanding of assembly is still limited to translations of C
programs, rather than unlocking its potential by moving away from direct
translation (i.e. the last part of the assignment)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

What is your mywc program test plan?

Statement tests:

mywc1char.txt
-Tests if mywc.s will properly increment lCharCount to 1, lWordCount to
1, and lLineCount to 0 for a text file containing only 1 character and
a newline

mywcreadme.txt
-Tests for a realistic situation using a readme file, and will hit every
statement a 'normal' input would reach

Boundary tests:

mywcempty.txt
-Tests if mywc.s will properly increment lCharCount to 0, lWordCount to
0, and lLineCount to 0 for a completely empty text file

mywc1charspace.txt
-Tests if mywc.s will properly increment lCharCount to 2, lWordCount to
1, and lLineCount to 0 for a text file containing a character followed
by whitespace

mywcspace1charspace.txt
-Tests if mywc.s will properly increment lCharCount to 3, lWordCount to
1, and lLineCount to 0 for a text file containing whitespace followed
by a character followed by more whitespace and then a newline

mywc2char.txt
-Tests if mywc.s will properly increment lCharCount to 2 and lWordCount
to 1 and lLineCount to 0 for a text file containing only two
consecutive characters

mywc3char.txt
-Tests if mywc.s will properly increment lCharCount to 3 and lWordCount
to 1 and lLineCount to 0 for a text file containing only three
consecutive characters

mywc2char2word.txt
-Tests if mywc.s will properly increment lCharCount to 3 and lWordCount
to 2 and lLineCount to 0 for a text file containing two characters
separated by whitespace

mywc3word.txt
-Tests if mywc.s will properly increment lCharCount to 15, lWordCount
to 3, and lLineCount to 0 for a text file containing three words of
four letters each with whitespace in between

mywcalllines.txt
-Tests if mywc will properly increment lCharCount to 71 and lLineCount
to 71 and lWordCount to 0 for a text file containing only 71 newline
characters

mywclinechar.txt
-Tests for a boundary case where a new line and then a character are
encountered, where lLineCount should be 1, lWordCount should be 1, and
lCharCount should be 2

Stress tests:

mywcstress.txt
-File containing every ASCII character, tests the functionality both
when the file contains an exceedingly large number of characters and
when every ASCII character is used
