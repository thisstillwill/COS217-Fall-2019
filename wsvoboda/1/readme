What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

Okay introduction to C, but I always hate how cos classes make you learn
all these tools like emacs and gcc217 without much prior practice. I get
that to a certain extent this is a somewhat secondary concern and the
point of the course is to learn the underlying systems, but I feel that
precept should have been a bit more hands on with these tools. One 20min
session in the terminal in precept is simply not enough.
